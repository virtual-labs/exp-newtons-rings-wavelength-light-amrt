### Thin film interference

A film is said to be thin when its thickness is about the order of one wavelength of visible light which is taken to be 550 nm.  When light is incident on such a film, a small portion gets reflected from the upper surface and a major portion is transmitted into the film. Again a small part of the transmitted component is reflected back into the film by the lower surface and the rest of it emerges out of the film. These reflected beams reunite to produce interference.  Also the transmitted beams too interfere.  This type of interference that takes place in thin films is called interference by division of amplitude.

$\theta_{1}$   angle of incidence at medium 1 to medium 2 boundary.<br>
$\theta_{2}$    angle of refraction at medium 1 to medium 2 boundary.<br>
$\theta_{3}$    angle of refraction at medium 2 to medium 3 boundary.<br>
$r_{12}$    reflected light from medium 1 to medium 2 boundary.<br>
$r_{23}$    reflected light from medium 2 to medium 1 boundary.<br>
$r_{21}$    reflected light from medium 2 to medium 3 boundary.<br>
$t_{21}$    transmitted light from medium 2 to medium 1 boundary.<br>
$t_{23}$    transmitted light from medium 2 to medium 3 boundary.<br>
$d$       thickness of the film.<br>


In the above figure the rays $r_{12}$ and $t_{21}$ interfere and results in a constructive or destructive interference depending on their path differences, given as,

**constructive interference** <br>
$$2\mu_{2}d\cos r_{12}=(2m+1)\frac{\lambda}{2}$$

**destructive interference** <br>

$$2\mu_{2}d\cos r_{12}=m\lambda$$

Where, $\mu_{2}$: refractive index of the  medium 2 and  $m=0,1,2,...$   the order of interference.
The transmitted light from $t_{23}$ can also interfere and result in constructive or destructive interference.


### Thin film interference with films of varying thickness (Newton's rings):

<div style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;"> <img src="./images/figure2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"> <p style="text-align: center; font-size: smaller; font-style: italic;">Figure 2: arrangement of plano-convex lens and plane glass for the thin film formation.</p> </div>

Rings are fringes of equal thickness.  They are observed when light is reflected from a plano-convex lens of a long focal length placed in contact with a plane glass plate.  A thin air film is formed between the plate and the lens.  The thickness of the air film varies from zero at the point of contact to some value t.  If the lens plate system is illuminated with monochromatic light falling on it normally, concentric bright and dark interference rings are observed in reflected light.  These circular fringes were discovered by Newton and are called Newtonâ€™s rings.

A ray AB incident normally on the system gets partially reflected at the bottom curved surface of the lens (Ray 1) and part of the transmitted ray is partially reflected (Ray 2) from the top surface of the plane glass plate.  The rays 1 and 2 are derived from the same incident ray by division of amplitude and therefore are coherent.  Ray 2 undergoes a phase change of p upon reflection since it is reflected from air-to-glass boundary.
