  <li>
    In a Newton's ring experiment, radius of 8th bright ring observed as 1.95 mm with a 75 cm radii lens. Calculate the wavelength of the light used?
  </li>

  <li>
    A plano-convex lens of radius 3 m is placed on an optically flat glass plate and is illuminated by Neon light. The diameter of the 8th dark ring in the reflected system is 7.2 mm. Calculate the wavelength of the light used?
  </li>

  <li>
    A thin equi-convex lens of focal length 4 m and refractive index 1.5 is placed on an optically flat glass plate. Using a light of wavelength 546 nm, Newton's rings are viewed normally by reflection. What is the diameter of the fifth bright ring?
  </li>

  <li>
    Newton’s rings are observed by keeping a spherical surface of 100 cm radius on a plane glass plate. The wavelength of light used is 5880 Å. If the diameter of the 15th bright ring is 0.60 cm, then what is the diameter of the 5th ring?
  </li>

  <li>
    Monochromatic light with a wavelength of 648 nm shines down on a plano-convex lens atop a plate glass. Newton's rings are seen when viewed from a superior position. 
    <br>(a) Radius of the 6th bright ring is 0.78 cm. What is the radius of curvature of the lens?
    <br>(b) If the light is changed to a greater wavelength, will the 6th ring remain in the same position?
