      "question": "Two waves of same frequency and amplitude meet at a point where they are 180<sup>0</sup> out of phase. Which of the following is correct?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "They superimpose, resulting in zero intensity",
        "b": "Their amplitudes subtract, resulting in zero amplitude",
        "c": "Destructive interference occurs",
        "d": "Their energy at that point disappear and thus the energy of the waves after interference is half that of the original waves"
